Individual project for Fall 2021: Part 1

## Notes for IAs that are grading:
I have developed this before we were told to branch our main branch.
As of right now, I have a branch called Part 1 when I believe that I have isolated my part 1 homework.
I also have a branch called "part 2" that holds the submission for part 2, my most updated version of the homework is maintained in main.
